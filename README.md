# MovieDBRes
<p> Implementing MovieDB to practice: ViewCode, MVVM, Coordinator and Service Layer in Swift 
(very simple version, design can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/file/JoSB1nDjFNWeUeMVXOmAtx/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=22xMbLsolAU8Q41V-0) </p>
<br/>
<p>Service Layer can be found at the folder "Backend" and it was highly inspired by: https://betterprogramming.pub/highly-customizable-network-layer-in-swift-5-1e5c1e163674</p>
<br/>
<p> To study ViewCode and MVVM we used this series of videos from BackFront Academy (PT-BR): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRv8nmRe0mQ&list=PLQ1R_-BgWHXSKtmKj5FG56QXvTCMiiPp5 </p>
